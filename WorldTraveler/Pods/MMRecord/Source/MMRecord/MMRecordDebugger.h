/**
 This class is intended as the primary access point for debugging model configuration
 and response handling issues and errors that may occur while building your application
 with MMRecord. This class is called a Debugger to indicate that it is not intended
 to be used in production. It is designed to help you while configuring your
 model and setting up your requests.
 
 You may still use MMRecordDebugger to handle actual errors in a production setting.
 However, you should also understand that these issues typically should never happen
 in production, and likely mean that your API has broken or is experiencing
 unexpected behavior. Please plan accordingly.
 
 MMRecordDebugger combines both error handling and debug logging to provide you with
 helpful feedback about issues in your model configuration and response handling.
 The type of errors handled by the debugger are listed above. Those errors
 will be added to over time to provide even more helpful feedback.
